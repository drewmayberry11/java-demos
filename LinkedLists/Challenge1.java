/**
 * Challenge 1 â€” Train Car Manager
 *
 * Description:
 * You are modeling a train with cars attached in order.
 * Each car is represented by a string (e.g., "Engine", "Cargo", "Passenger").
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. Start with an empty train.
 * 2. Add cars to the front or back (simulate attaching cars).
 * 3. Remove the first and last car safely (no crashes if train is empty).
 * 4. Print the train in order like:
 * Engine -> Cargo -> Passenger -> null
 *
 * Hints:
 * - Stack-like operations: use push/offerFirst for attaching at the front.
 * - Queue-like operations: use offerLast/poll for attaching/removing at ends.
 * - Use safe removal (poll) since it returns null instead of throwing
 * exceptions.
 *
 * Example:
 * Empty Train
 * Engine -> Cargo -> Passenger -> null
 * Engine was removed
 * Passenger was removed
 * Cargo -> null
 * No car was removed
 * No car was removed
